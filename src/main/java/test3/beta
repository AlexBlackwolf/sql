Certainly! Here's an exercise for you to solve:

Exercise: Managing a Product Inventory

Create a table called "Products" in the database with the following columns:

ID (int, primary key)
Name (varchar)
Price (double)
Quantity (int)
Create a Java class called "InventoryManagement" that connects to the database using JDBC.

Add a method in the "InventoryManagement" class called "createProductsTable()" that executes the SQL query to create the "Products" table in the database.

Add a method called "addProduct(Product product)" that accepts a "Product" object as a parameter and inserts the product data into the "Products" table in the database.

Add a method called "getProducts()" that executes an SQL query to retrieve all products from the "Products" table in the database and returns a list of "Product" objects.

Create a class called "Product" with attributes corresponding to the columns of the "Products" table in the database.

In the "main" method of the "InventoryManagement" class, perform the following operations:

Create an object of "InventoryManagement" and call the "createProductsTable()" method to create the "Products" table in the database.
Create several "Product" objects with sample data and use the "addProduct(Product product)" method to insert them into the database.
Use the "getProducts()" method to retrieve the products from the database and print them on the screen.
This exercise provides a foundation for implementing a product inventory management system using JDBC in Java. You can further expand the code by adding additional functionalities, such as updating or deleting products.
