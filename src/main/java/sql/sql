Apologies for the misunderstanding. Here are all the CRUD operations you can include in a DAO class in Java:

Create:

void create(Entity entity): Creates a new record by inserting the provided entity object into the database.
Entity createAndReturn(Entity entity): Creates a new record and returns the newly created entity object.
Read:

Entity findById(Object id): Retrieves an entity by its unique identifier.
List<Entity> findAll(): Retrieves all entities from the database.
List<Entity> findByCriteria(Criteria criteria): Retrieves entities based on specific criteria or conditions.
List<Entity> findByProperty(String propertyName, Object value): Retrieves entities by a specific property value.
List<Entity> findByExample(Entity exampleEntity): Retrieves entities based on an example entity object.
List<Entity> findByQuery(String query, Object... parameters): Retrieves entities using a custom query and optional parameters.
Update:

void update(Entity entity): Updates an existing entity in the database.
void updateProperty(Object id, String propertyName, Object value): Updates a specific property of an entity.
void updateByExample(Entity exampleEntity): Updates entities based on an example entity object.
void updateByQuery(String query, Object... parameters): Updates entities using a custom query and optional parameters.
Delete:

void delete(Entity entity): Deletes an entity from the database.
void deleteById(Object id): Deletes an entity by its unique identifier.
void deleteByProperty(String propertyName, Object value): Deletes entities by a specific property value.
void deleteAll(): Deletes all entities from the database.
void deleteByQuery(String query, Object... parameters): Deletes entities using a custom query and optional parameters.
Additionally, you may also consider including methods for pagination, sorting, and other specific requirements based on your application needs.

Certainly! Here's an example of the query structure for each CRUD operation:

Create:

Insert Query: INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (?, ?, ...)
Read:

Select by ID Query: SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE id = ?
Select All Query: SELECT * FROM table_name
Select by Criteria Query: SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE <criteria>
Select by Property Query: SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE property_name = ?
Select by Example Query: SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE <example_conditions>
Custom Query: <custom_query>
Update:

Update Query: UPDATE table_name SET column1 = ?, column2 = ..., WHERE id = ?
Update Property Query: UPDATE table_name SET property_name = ? WHERE id = ?
Update by Example Query: UPDATE table_name SET <updated_values> WHERE <example_conditions>
Custom Update Query: <custom_update_query>
Delete:

Delete Query: DELETE FROM table_name WHERE id = ?
Delete by Property Query: DELETE FROM table_name WHERE property_name = ?
Delete All Query: DELETE FROM table_name
Delete by Query: <custom_delete_query>
Please note that these are general query structures, and you need to replace table_name, column1, column2, property_name, id, <criteria>, <example_conditions>, <custom_query>, <updated_values>, and <custom_delete_query> with the appropriate table and column names, criteria, conditions, or custom query strings based on your specific database schema and requirements.

Additionally, don't forget to use proper parameter binding or sanitization techniques to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities when using dynamic values in your queries.
